# Build NLP From Scratch

A curated collection of hands-on Natural Language Processing projects designed to build deep understanding through implementation. Each mini-project focuses on core NLP concepts with clear, educational code that prioritizes learning over production complexity.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **Master NLP Fundamentals**: Implement core algorithms and techniques from the ground up
- **Hands-On Practice**: Build practical skills through project-based learning
- **Conceptual Clarity**: Understand the "why" behind NLP methods, not just the "how"
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with foundations and advance to modern techniques

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each directory contains a self-contained mini-project with notebooks, source code, and documentation:

```
01_data-pipelines/           # Text preprocessing and data pipeline construction
02_classical-text-models/    # Bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and traditional ML approaches
03_sequence-models-classical/ # N-grams, HMMs, and classical sequence modeling
04_embeddings/               # Word2Vec, GloVe, and embedding techniques
05_sequence-models-neural/   # RNNs, LSTMs, and neural sequence modeling
06_attention-transformers/   # Attention mechanisms and transformer architectures
07_language-modeling/        # Language model training and evaluation
08_sequence-tasks/           # NER, POS tagging, and sequence labeling
09_retrieval-augmented/      # RAG systems and information retrieval
10_prompt-engineering/       # Prompt design and optimization techniques
11_evaluation/               # Metrics, benchmarking, and model assessment

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kira-ml/build-nlp-from-scratch.git
cd build-nlp-from-scratch

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv nlp-env
source nlp-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: nlp-env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies for a specific project
cd 01_data-pipelines
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run example notebooks
jupyter notebook
```

### Project Structure
Each project follows a consistent structure:
```
project-name/
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks with explanations
├── src/               # Clean Python modules
├── data/              # Sample datasets
├── reports/           # Generated analysis and visualizations
├── tests/             # Unit tests for key functions
└── requirements.txt   # Project-specific dependencies
```

## 🎯 Target Audience

This repository is designed for:
- **Intermediate Python developers** learning NLP
- **Students and professionals** seeking practical NLP experience
- **Self-learners** who prefer hands-on implementation over theory
- **Anyone** wanting to understand NLP algorithms at a fundamental level

## 📖 Learning Approach

- **Implementation First**: Build algorithms before using libraries
- **Clear Documentation**: Every project includes detailed explanations
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Real Examples**: Use practical datasets and realistic scenarios
