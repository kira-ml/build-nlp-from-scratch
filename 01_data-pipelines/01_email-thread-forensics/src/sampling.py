Email Dataset Sampling and Validation Pipeline

This module implements a robust data preprocessing pipeline for email datasets
used in NLP and ML applications. The pipeline performs dataset validation,
stratified sampling, and persistence with comprehensive integrity checks.

The implementation follows production-grade ML engineering practices including:
- Explicit path management and validation
- Deterministic sampling with configurable parameters  
- Comprehensive data integrity verification
- Clear separation of concerns through modular functions

This preprocessing stage is critical for downstream email thread analysis,
where data quality directly impacts model performance and interpretability.

Example:
    >>> # Execute full sampling pipeline
    >>> python sampling.py
